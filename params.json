  "body": "##What is 'The List'?\r\nThe list came about after the initial swarm of topics and examples that were created for `vba` and `excel-vba` tags on [Stack Overflow Documentation](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/). There is still some uncertainty around how duplicate content and language sub-sets are going to be handled and so in the meantime a group of like minded individuals thought it would be a good idea to start a collaborative effort in cleaning up the mess before it gets out of hand.\r\n\r\nIf you have a suggestion for the list, send a request, or you can join the discussion in the [VBA Lounge](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/111528/vba-lounge)\r\n\r\nYou can view the list [here](https://macro-man.github.io/VBA-Documentation-Cleanup/list)\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n+ [Macro Man](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4240221/macro-man) (@Macro-Man)\r\n+ [Jeeped](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4039065/jeeped) (@Jeeped)\r\n+ [Comintern](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4088852/comintern) (@comintern)\r\n+ [Gary Evans](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6299399/gary-evans) (@garye686)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can get in touch with us via the [VBA Lounge](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/111528/vba-lounge) in chat.\r\n",
